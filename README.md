# 🚗 Vehicle Service Center Management System

A **console-based Java application** for managing vehicle service center operations. This project is built using **core Java** and **basic collections** like `ArrayList`, `Queue`, `Set`, and `TreeSet`, avoiding all `Map`-based collections. It is ideal for learning object-oriented programming and collection handling in Java.
